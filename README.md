# Self Driving Car Simulator

This repository implements a fully autonomous self driving car in Udacity's SDC Simulator using Non-Linear regression with Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs). The Neural Network model has been implemented using Keras and Udacity's SDC app works as a testbed for training the autonomous car model. After 300 epochs, the model generalizes the dataset and converges to a deployable set of weights.

## Dependencies

You can install all dependencies by running one of the following commands
You need anaconda or miniconda to use the environment setting.

`conda env create -f environments.yml `

Or you can manually install the required libraries (see the contents of the environemnt.yml file) using pip.
